    <p>
      Currently a Senior Product Designer at
      <a href="https://squarespace.com">Squarespace</a>, I specialize in
      clarifying complex ecosystems, creating digital experiences in physical
      spaces, and prototyping ideas in code.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the Trial Experience team at Squarespace I create onboarding,
      educational features, and cross-team collaborations that enable a coherent
      user experience across the full product and drive business growth.
      Additionally, I build tools and processes that empower collaboration
      between designers and engineers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Previously I worked in Experience Design at
      <a href="https://rga.com">R/GA</a>, where I built products and
      tech-enabled consumer experiences for the worldâ€™s biggest brands inlcuding
      Samsung, Mercedes, Equinox, and Verizon.
